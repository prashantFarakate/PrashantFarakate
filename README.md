## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Having **5 years of experience** across **Business Analysis and Quality Assurance** in the ERP domain, working on **AI-enabled document processing systems**.

My work focuses on bridging business requirements with AI and engineering teams to deliver reliable, scalable GenAI solutions. I have hands-on experience with LLM-based systems, including entity extraction, document classification, OCR, and prompt engineering, and exposure to modern AI architectures such as Agentic AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vector Databases, and MCP-based workflows.

Currently, I’m transitioning toward **AI Product Management**, supported by formal training through **HelloPM** and practical experience on GenAI products.
